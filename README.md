# CSE168AI-MLDistributed-Tensorflow-Project-Student-Naturalist-
This is a project with Amy, team member names for UC Merced's CSE168 Distributed Systems class taught by Professor Xiaoyi Lu lab part two using a custom dataset and custom tensorflow model.

The goal of this project is to track a computer vision model like iNaturalist through using instance segmentation and semantic segmentation (2 approaches) to conduct object detection and image classification of wildlife.

1st task:
Only 1 cat and same cat
Extract Regions of Interest: Extract the cat from the image using semantic segmentation using the Unet Segmentation Tensorflow Model
Binary Classification: Identify the regions of the image if pixel is cat or not through Support Vector Machine (SVN) algorithm
